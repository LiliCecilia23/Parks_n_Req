 ## Instructions for Use 
 Load the web app in your browser and scroll down to the image map. Each of the red pins notates a park. Click on desired red pin and a modal will pop up with the parks name and the option to view that parks page or close the modal to choose another park.
 Once a park has been chosen, the park page will have an abundance of information about the park and the correlating campsite, including amenities, regulations, accessibility, contact and so forth. 
 If the park offers reservations, you can click the reservation button and fill out the form. 
 Once the form is completed and submitted, you will be redirected to the reservation confirmation page and be ready to go on your camping excursion!
